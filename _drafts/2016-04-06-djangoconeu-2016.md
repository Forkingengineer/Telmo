Imagine this you're on stage and you have a captive audience of 300+ people.  That's the view I faced just a week ago, as I presented 'Learning Django, Learning French' (an extension of my ['Learning Django, Learning French' talk](http://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/12/14/my-talk-at-pycon-fr.html)) the audience at DjangoCon Europe 2016.

You can judge for yourself the success of my talk - but in any case, I'd like to thank the organisers of DjangoCon Europe for having me on stage. I'd also like to thank those community members who gave me so much positive feedback and made my conference experience great!
