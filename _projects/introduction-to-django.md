    ## The Opportunity
    In late 2015, I was asked if I would be interested in putting together a screencast to help new Django developers build their first application - I jumped at the opportunity.

    The result is a comprehensive 40 part screencast series where I walk new Djangonauts through the process of building, testing and deploying a fully functional web application called [ReadIt](https://github.com/nlhkabu/readit).

    My goal in writing and recording the series was to provide newcomers with enough knowledge and confidence to start building their own applications straight away. For this reason, I covered Django fundamentals (models, admin, views, forms, templates) as well as authentication, testing, CI and deployment.

    The first six episodes are available to view free over at [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045533.do). Here is a peak of episode six for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy!
