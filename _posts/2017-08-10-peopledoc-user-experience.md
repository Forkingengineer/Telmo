comments: 'off'

As part of my work at [PeopleDoc](http://www.people-doc.com/), I was recently interviewed by [Nicole Lindenbaum](https://twitter.com/NicolePeopleDoc) on our approach to UX and the development of PeopleDoc UI - our internal design system.

The interview was split into three parts:

- [Introducing PeopleDoc UI - what and why](http://www.people-doc.com/blog/improving-your-user-experience)
- [Building and rolling out PeopleDoc UI](http://www.people-doc.com/blog/user-experience-principles-in-action)
- [Defining great UX and how we measure success](http://www.people-doc.com/blog/user-experience-principles)

A big thanks to Nicole for organising and publishing this content!
