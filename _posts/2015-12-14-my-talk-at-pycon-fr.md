In October 2015, I had the opportunity to present at [PyConFr](http://www.pycon.fr/2015/) in the beautiful city of [Pau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau,_Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques). My talk explored my experiences of learning Python and French at the same time and looked at what the Python community could take from the language learning community to better help new learners.

I'd like to thank the organisers of PyConFr for having me - it was a terrific conference, and I was so happy to present my ideas to such a warm and welcoming group of Pythonistas. Thanks also to all those attendees who were patient with my less than perfect French, or happy to switch to English when I got stuck!

The talk is in English, with a brief introduction in French (for which I have provided subtitles). Enjoy!
