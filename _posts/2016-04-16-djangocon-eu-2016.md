title: Presenting at DjangoCon Europe
summary: In March 2016 I had the opportunity to present 'Learning Django, Learning French' at DjangoCon Europe in Budapest, Hungary.
comments: 'on'

Imagine this you're on stage and you have a captive audience of 300+ people.  That's the view I faced just a few weeks ago, as I presented 'Learning Django, Learning French' (an extension of my ['Learning Django, Learning French' talk](http://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/12/14/my-talk-at-pycon-fr.html)) to the audience at DjangoCon Europe 2016.

You can judge for yourself the success of my talk - in any case, I'd like to thank the organisers of DjangoCon Europe for having me on stage. I'd also like to thank those community members who gave me so much positive feedback and made my conference experience great!

All of the videos for the conference can be found [on Opbeat's website](https://opbeat.com/events/djangocon-eu-2016/).  In particular, I'd like to highlight the talk by Erik Romijn and Mikey Ariel entitled "Healthy Minds in a Healthy Community" as an important message for everyone trying to find a healthy balance working in open source.
